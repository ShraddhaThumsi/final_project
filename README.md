# final_project
This codebase was written as part of the final Machine Learning course project at the University of Arizona. It was the result of collaboration between Shraddha Thumsi and Liliana Salas. However, Shraddha took the lead in the project.  
The dataset used for the project has been left out from this repository due to privacy reasons, but all the code I wrote is here.
I used Python 3.6 for this project, with additional libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib 

In addition to coding the project, we wrote the report using LaTeX. That has been added into this repository as well.
